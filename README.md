# Course Material Downloader

I created this project to help my friends who are taking the same courses as me. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to access and download the course materials without repeating the same steps manually.

## ðŸ“¥ How to Download Any Course Material

To download the content for a specific course, just run the program with the course name as an argument.

### Example:

```bash
./program_name bil344
```

Replace `bil344` with any other course code you want. The program will automatically fetch the correct file if available.

That's all. Simple, fast, and for everyone.
