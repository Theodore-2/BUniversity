# Başkent University Course Material Manager

> I created this repository to help my fellow classmates at Başkent University access and manage course materials more easily. This is especially useful for those who are taking the same classes and want a streamlined way to get updated content without repetitive steps.

## 📥 How to Download Any Course Material

This project assumes that materials are stored in this GitHub repository and organized by course code.

### 🔄 Step-by-Step Instructions

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository (only once)
git clone https://github.com/Theodore-2/BUniversity.git
cd BUniversity

# Step 2: Pull latest updates (run this regularly)
git pull origin main

# Step 3: Run the program with your course code
./program_name bil344
```

> 💡 Replace `bil344` with any course you want to access.  
> For example: `cse395`, `bil332`, `bil218`, etc.

The program will automatically locate and process the corresponding content inside the repository.
